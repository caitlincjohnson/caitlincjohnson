## Professional Experience

Yep, that's me in the photo. I've been a Data Engineer since October 2018 when I first joined Zeeto, a fast-paced startup in San Diego. Since then I've seen a variety of data engineering practices which has grown my professional background and helped me gain appreciation for best practices. Shown below is a short summary of what I'm familiar with:

- Languages: Python, SQL, JavaScript/ReactJS
- Relational Databases: Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server
- Cloud Platforms: Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse, Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- NoSQL Databases: Apache Cassandra, MongoDB
- Technologies: Airflow, Looker, Git, Docker, Prefect
- Development Strategies: Functional programming, object-oriented programming, pair/mob programming, test-driven development, behavior-driven development, model-view-controller

Recently, I sparked a significant interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, so I created a Github repository to showcase my current learnings, projects, referenced resources, and more. It can be found here: https://github.com/caitlincjohnson/machine-learning

I live on a farm so "free time" is a bit limited for me, but shown below are some of my hobbies:

- Taking photos. If you see me in public, there's a good chance that I've got my Fujifilm camera with me. 
- Traveling to lesser known places with intention. I always intend to learn a little bit about the native language(s), cuisines, and whatnot. Some of my favorite places so far are Bolivia, Chile, and Chiapas (Mexico).
- Learning about my Polish heritage and culture.

Again thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and please reach out if you'd like additional information about my professional experience or would like to collaborate on a project!
